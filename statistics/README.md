# cbseresults
Statistical analysis of CBSE results. The idea is to show interesting analysis among various subjects and also highlight CBSE's notorious practice of moderation.

Results are arranged per year, and the only file in many cases will be a README.md that will link to my OneDrive, as the files are simply too large for GitHub.

NOTE: If you are using the Excel version (.xlsb), note that

* the macros in it are completely safe and have a history of their own; they are not required to view the data
* IMPORTANT: DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING IN THE FILE! Turn off AutoSave if you have it. A single modification can cause Excel to HANG for hours and then calculate for more hours (the final calculation for the 2015 version took over 32 hours to calculate on three threads on a Core i5-6500 @ 3.3 GHz). Do not sort or run the macros either - use Find instead.
