# CBSE statistical results
Statistical analysis of CBSE results. The idea is to show interesting analysis among various subjects and also highlight CBSE's notorious practice of moderation.

Results are arranged per year, and the only file in many cases will be a README.md that will link to my OneDrive, as the files are simply too large for GitHub.

The 2015 dataset is the subject of my third report: https://github.com/Leader-board/Reports/blob/master/Report%203%20-%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Azure.pdf.

The datasets for both years are available under GitHub releases.
