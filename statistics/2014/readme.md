# CBSE 2014 statistics

I scraped this data from the CBSE website. Currently consists of more than 9.6 lakh (0.96 million) of students' data, and available in a raw CSV form and a processed XLSB file format, along with full SPSS processed data. Also includes analysis of names: most popular first and last names, along with briefly analysing the average marks per first name (the results are slightly surprising, but I don't have a good explanation for them yet).

The full data (raw and processed) is available [here](https://universityofstandrews907-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/dm282_st-andrews_ac_uk/EuQHAxsipPNCv9w4G_29F-MBnlF5mA0RHDW3-LV6FX1l1A?e=hba23n).
