# CBSE 2015 Analysis

The data for this analysis was taken from https://github.com/KaushikR/CbseScraper, many thanks to him for providing that.

Processing this data took a lot of time, not least because I did a good chunk of the work in Excel.

The results are available here: https://universityofstandrews907-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/dm282_st-andrews_ac_uk/Er6jucuWMeJBkTSlYDPst0YBORbwNMVkszrM02MEUIFdyA?e=oLndjA

It includes the files in Excel (.xlsb) format and in IBM SPSS format (raw and statistical results). A PDF version of the statistical results is also available, and it's highly recommended that you take a look at that.
