# Past question papers

Historical question papers for both Class 10 and 12 scraped from CBSE's website (while usually publicly accessible, they were not linked from anywhere in the public website). Much of the content would have been outdated by now, but it might still be useful for some science subjects.

Also included are question papers form 2010 up to 2015 - those papers are more recent, and should fit the current syllabus very well except for some subjects (of course, the exam pattern for some subjects have changed, but the questions are still suitable to a great extent).

Also see http://cbse.nic.in/student.htm and http://cbse.nic.in/examarch.htm (for papers from 2008).
