# Past question papers

Historical question papers for both Class 10 and 12 scraped from CBSE's website. Much of the content would have been outdated by now, but it might still be useful for some science subjects.

Also see http://cbse.nic.in/student.htm and http://cbse.nic.in/examarch.htm (for papers from 2008).
